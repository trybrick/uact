# uact - UTM auto click tracker

This script automatically track clicks of anchor and buttons when there is a utm_campaign querystring in the URL.  This is to facilitate automatic conversion tracking.

Of course, when goals are defined, this does not replace manual conversion tracking.  Instead, it create a new event ('uact') to help with manual conversion tracking.
